However, people change, and after jumping on the vim bandwagon about\r\nsix months ago I forgot about both the plugin and Matt's post.\r\n\r\nEventually I found myself in the position to be doing some academic writing\r\nagain, and was frustrutated when I couldn't find a similar plugin for vim, so\r\nafter reading Steve Losh's 'Learn Vimscript the Hard Way' I decided to write one\r\nfor myself.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n* Matt Might's original [blog post](http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/)\r\n* Benjamin Beckwiths [emacs minor-mode](https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode)\r\n* Steve Losh's [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/)\r\n* Nate Kane's [vim-indent-guides](https://github.com/nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides)\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n* Matt Might for writing the original scripts.\r\n* Benjamin Beckwith for the emacs mode and catchy title I've borrowed.\r\n* Steve Losh for 'Learn Vimscript the Hard Way'.\r\n* Nathaniel Kane for the vim-indent-guides plugin, which I used as a\r\n    reference for structuring and documentation.\r\n    \r\n### Contact  \r\n* Twitter: @dabeckingsale\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any suggestions for improving my dodgy match usage, it would be\r\nmuch appreciated.
