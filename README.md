# Writegood.vim

Writegood is a plugin to highlight common writing problems.

The plugin uses the `Error` group to highlight errors, so I assume it will work
on both gvim and terminal vim.

## Features
* Detects duplicate words (even over newlines)
* Highlights use of passive voice
* Highlights common "weasel words"

## About

After reading Matt Might's blog post about a year ago, I was thrilled when I
came across Benjamin Beckwith's writegood mode for Emacs, my editor of choice at
the time. However, people change, and after jumping on the vim bandwagon about
six months ago I forgot about both the plugin and Matt's post.

Eventually I found myself in the position to be doing some academic writing
again, and was frustrutated when I couldn't find a similar plugin for vim, so
after reading Steve Losh's 'Learn Vimscript the Hard Way' I decided to write one
for myself.

If anyone has any suggestions for improving my dodgy match usage, it would be
much appreciated.
